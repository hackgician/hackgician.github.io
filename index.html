Hackgician is actually just an account owned by Co-Founder Andy Kamath (it's a long story). Anyhow, if you want to visit the Hackgician official website, it's <a href="http://hackgician.net">hackgicianAPPS.github.io</a>, Andy Kamath's website is at <a href="http://andykamath.com">andykamath.com</a>, and James Seddon has yet to make a website.</h3>
